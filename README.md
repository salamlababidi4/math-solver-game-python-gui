# Math Solver Game Python
A simple Python-based math-solving game created using the tkinter library for graphical user interface (GUI). The game is designed to challenge players with random math questions, testing their speed and accuracy under a time limit. Players must solve math problems quickly to earn points before time runs out.


**Features:**

Random Math Questions: The game generates random math questions using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Timer: The player has 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible. The timer counts down with each second.
Score System: The player earns a point for each correct answer. The score is displayed and updated in real-time.
User-Friendly Interface: The interface is clean and simple, with the ability to enter answers and view questions clearly.
Game Over Screen: When the timer runs out, a game over screen displays the player's score.


**How to Play:**

Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
Solve the math questions by typing your answers into the input box and pressing "Enter."
Continue solving questions as quickly as possible to rack up points.
The game ends when the timer reaches zero, and your final score will be displayed.
